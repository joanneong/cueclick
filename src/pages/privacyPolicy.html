        <p class="subheading">What information does Cue Click collect?</p>
            <p class="point">Personal Information</p>
            <p>
                When you sign into your Google account via Cue Click, you may provide
                to Cue Click personal information related to your Google account that
                can be used to identify you (such as your name and email address).
            </p>
            <p class="point">Google Drive information</p>
            <p>
                By signing in to your Google account through Cue Click, you also
                provide to Cue Click access to your presentations in your Google Drive.
                These presentations are not limited to Google Slides, and may include
                any other presnentations you create/upload in your Google Drive such as
                .pptx and .ppt files.
            </p>

        <p class="subheading">How does Cue Click use the collected information?</p>
            <p class="point"> To enhance the services and functionalities that Cue Click
                provides</p>
            <p>
                Cue Click uses the information that you provide or Cue Click collects
                to operate, enhance and provide all of the features and services found on
                Cue Click. For example, Cue Click uses information from your Google Drive to
                retrieve and display presentations stored in your Google Drive account. Since
                Cue Click does not require any registration, Cue Click will only retain your
                information (personal or otherwise) for as long as you are signed in to your
                Google account. Once you have signed out from your Google account via Cue
                Click, Cue Click ceases to store or remember any information related to you or
                your Google account.
            </p>

        <p class="subheading">What information does Cue Click share?</p>
            <p class="point">Cue Click may share data with relevant third-party service
                providers (Google and Heroku)</p>
            <p>
                Cue Click builds upon Google services including (but not limited to) Google
                Drive, Google Slides, and Google Picker. Additionally, Cue Click is deployed
                using Heroku, a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Consequently,
                Cue Click may allow these third-party service providers to place and read their
                own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information through
                Cue Click. This information is collected automatically and directly by these
                third parties, and Cue Click does not participate in these data transmissions.
            </p>

        <p class="subheading">Changes and updates to this privacy policy</p>
            <p>
                From time to time, Cue Click may modify or update this privacy policy.
                Cue Click will notify Users of any changes to the privacy policy by
                ensuring that the updated privacy policy bears the most recent date
                of revision, such that Users are able to discern when the privacy policy
                has been changed.
