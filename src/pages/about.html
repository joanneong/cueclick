        Presentations are important; they communicate and sell our ideas to a target
        audience. We try to perfect our presentations, but it can be expensive and
        bothersome to do so. Why? For a start, we need to control the slides during
        our presentation. Unfortunately, depending on our teammates can result in
        slides being confusingly out of sync with our presentation while a clicker
        is bulky, easy to forget, and not necessarily cheap (especially for students).
        Additionally, we may wish to reference our scripts during the presentation,
        but fumbling with a stack of cue-cards or worse, forgetting to bring the
        cue-cards can effectively destroy the entire presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This then begs the question: can we control our presentations in a cheaper
        and more convenient way?
      </p>

        The short answer is yes, we can - with Cue Click.
